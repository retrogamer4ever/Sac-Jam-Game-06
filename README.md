===============

This is the game I made in 6 hours for the game jam I host in my local city


The theme for this game was co-op, meaning the core mechanic had to involve some sort of cooperative play.
The interesting thing about it all is that I kept running into bugs but instead of figuring them out built out a new
mechanic around the bugs. The game evolved a lot from the orginial design and became not only cooperative but 
competitive as well.

The game is two player in the sense that one player uses the WASD keys and the second player uses the arrow keys. 
There are three levels, each player much hit a switch in the first level by jumping on top of the white button, then
this will make a green square appear at which point they will both need to raise to it first.

The second level the player on the left (WASD) keys must stand on top of the white switch to the far left and then the 
second player must move over to the left and hit the switch on the right side. Then they both must race to the left and
get the green square first. But also avoid the spikes

Finally the third level they most both just race to the green shape without touching the spikes. At the very end it will
sum up the points each player got from touching the green square first (or dying from spikes, other play gets point).
and show the color of who had the most points... Although that final part does seem to not be adding up correctly.

Overall I really liked how the game turned out, during the presentation at the end of the jam it got a loud cheer from
everyone when we were playing it in front of everyone. So I am pretty happy with it :-D I used Flixel to get everything
going.
